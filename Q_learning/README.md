# Q Learning
Use Q-Learning to find a good policy for Garl the gnome, who must navigate a perilous maze filled with dangerous obstacles. We will first use discrete states and then upgrade the problem to using continuous states (observation vectors), which will require using function approximation (e.g., a neural network). In both cases, we assume discrete time steps and discrete actions.
